# Blog-Homepage
This is a Blog homepage, with little animations from CSS3 &amp; VelocityJS.

The blog homepage is deployed here : https://bloghomepage.herokuapp.com/

You can grab the code directly from the public folder if you don't want to use the express server.

It includes some SASS code with the required Gulp file to compile it into CSS.

Idea comes from this : https://github.com/Kikobeats/uno-zen#uno-zen-for-ghost. I just rewrote it to try it myself.
